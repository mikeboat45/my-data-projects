The project focuses on leveraging hotel booking data to gain a deeper understanding of booking trends and behaviours. This analysis will explore factors influencing booking lead time, early booking patterns, cancellation rates, and occupancy trends. Identifying these patterns will help to provide actionable recommendations to help the hotel management reduce cancellations, increase early bookings, optimize pricing strategies, and ultimately improve occupancy rates. The insights drawn will also support data-driven decision-making, enabling the hotel to better predict demand and allocate resources more efficiently.
